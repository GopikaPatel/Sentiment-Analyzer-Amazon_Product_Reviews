# Sentiment-Analyzer-Amazon_Product_Reviews
Sentiment Analyzer for Amazon Kindle Reviews.

Overview

The Sentiment Analyzer project aims to develop a robust sentiment analysis platform that leverages advanced natural language processing (NLP) techniques to analyze and categorize text data based on sentiment polarity (positive or negative). The system will analyze the text of product reviews and classify them as positive or negative.
To achieve these goals, the project leverages a range of machine learning models tailored for text classification. Specifically, the models used include Support Vector Classifier (LinearSVC), Random Forest, and Logistic Regression.We finally use the LinearSVC model for making the predictions due to its high accuracy of around90% 

The project also includes the development of a user-friendly web application using the Dash framework (app.py)

It also contains a text file containing sample review texts (positive and negative) which you can use to try out the model.

Excellent unit.  The versatility of this tablet, besides being competitively priced is a solution to the elderly.  Poor eyesight and physical disabilities associated with age and using the supporting add on features allows the user to stay in touch with our changing world.



I really like my fire HD 7! Luckily, I have not had one single issue with mine. I had a nook for many years and finally it started having problems. I hated to part with my nook because I had so many great books on it but I really wanted to try a kindle. I figured out how to download my nook books to my kindle and now I can read both my nook and kindle books anytime I want. LOVE LOVE LOVE!

Not at all happy had mine for a year since new it cuts out with no warning (plenty charge in battery)now it's started freezing when I touch screen to open an app and then has to be shut down and restarted to use but that does not always solve the problem I know I bought it for the books but I should be able to get more and you cannot get help to solve problems



I've had this for only a month and have had a LOT of problems with it.  It reboots randomly.  Half of the time my books won't open, or they close immediately.  It won't sync (over wi-fi at home) from my Kindle to my phone, or vice versa, despite having it set up that way.  It will even regress to chapters earlier, and won't save my bookmarks.We had an HDX that worked great, which is why I purchased this one on the July 15th Amazon sale.  I wonder if they sold defective ones for that discounted price.  Supremely disappointed.
